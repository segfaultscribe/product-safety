![alt text](<product safety.gif>)
Product-safety is a food product analysis tool.<br>

This is the official `backend` repository. The frontend is bare HTML, CSS, JS.<br>

It lets users look up products by **barcode or name**, fetches details from [OpenFoodFacts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), and uses an LLM to answer product-related questions like:

- "Is this safe if I have an allergy?"
- "Can I eat this while bodybuilding?"
- "How often can I consume this and stay in shape?"

## Features
- ðŸ”Ž Lookup products by barcode
- ðŸ“¦ Get key nutritional, allergen, and ingredient info  
- ðŸ’¬ Chat-like interface powered by LLM (powered by groq) for product Q&A  

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
- **DB:** No DB, just Redis!
- **APIs:** OpenFoodFacts, LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI)

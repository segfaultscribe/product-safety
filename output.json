  "answer": "**Short answer:**  \nBecause this spread is **high in sugars, saturated fat and overall energy (539 kcal per 100 g)**, most nutrition experts would advise limiting it to **about 1 – 2 small servings per week** (roughly 10–20 g each time).  \n\n---\n\n## Why the recommendation is so low\n\n| Nutrient (per 100 g) | What the label says | Why it matters for frequency |\n|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Energy**           | 539 kcal (2252 kJ)   | A single 20‑g spoonful already supplies ~108 kcal. |\n| **Sugars**           | 56.3 g (High)        | Represents ~23 % of the product’s weight; exceeds the WHO recommendation of <10 % of total daily energy from added sugars. |\n| **Saturated Fat**    | 10.6 g (High)        | One 20‑g portion gives ~2 g sat‑fat, already 10 % of the <20 g/day limit suggested for a 2000‑kcal diet. |\n| **Total Fat**        | 30.9 g (High)        | 20 g portion = 6 g fat, a noticeable chunk of the daily allowance. |\n| **Salt**             | 0.107 g (Low)        | Not a limiting factor here. |\n| **Protein**          | 6.3 g (moderate)     | Helpful, but outweighed by the sugar/fat load. |\n| **NOVA group**       | 4 (Highly processed) | Foods in this group are best eaten occasionally. |\n| **Nutrition score (France)** | 31 (low) | The lower the score, the less favorable the overall nutritional profile. |\n\n### Portion‑size illustration\n- **Typical “spoonful”**: ~15 g (≈ 2 Tbsp).  \n  - Calories ≈ 80 kcal  \n  - Sugars ≈ 8 g  \n  - Saturated fat ≈ 1.6 g  \n\nEven a modest spoonful already delivers a sizable share of the daily limits for added sugars and saturated fats.\n\n---\n\n## How to fit it into a balanced weekly diet\n\n| Frequency | Typical weekly intake (approx.) | Practical tip |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------|\n| **0 times** | If you already consume other high‑sugar, high‑fat spreads (e.g., chocolate hazelnut, Nutella‑type products) you may choose to omit this product altogether. |\n| **1 time** | 1‑2 spoonfuls (15‑30 g) in the week. | Use it as a *treat* on a weekend breakfast or as a thin spread on whole‑grain toast; pair with a protein‑rich food (e.g., Greek yogurt) to blunt blood‑sugar spikes. |\n| **2 times** | Up to ~30 g total (≈ 2 spoonfuls) in the week. | Keep the spread thin, avoid adding extra sugary toppings (jam, honey). |\n| **>2 times** | Not recommended unless you significantly lower sugars/fats elsewhere that day (e.g., no desserts, low‑fat dairy). | Might be okay for athletes with very high energy needs, but most people will exceed recommended limits. |\n\n---\n\n## Personalising the advice\n\n- **Energy needs:** If you have a higher daily calorie requirement (e.g., heavy training, manual work) you could afford a slightly larger portion, but the **sugar and sat‑fat** concerns still apply.\n- **Health conditions:**  \n  - *Diabetes / pre‑diabetes*: keep intake **very limited** (once a week, ≤ 10 g).  \n  - *Cardiovascular risk*: prioritize the **saturated‑fat** limit; aim for **≤ 1 time per week**.\n- **Other sources of similar nutrients:** If you already eat other sweet spreads, chocolate, pastries, sugary cereals, or high‑fat snacks, count this product toward the same “treat” budget.\n\n---\n\n## Practical ways to enjoy it responsibly\n\n1. **Measure** – Use a kitchen spoon or a small kitchen scale to keep the portion at 10‑15 g.  \n2. **Combine with fiber** – Spread a thin layer on whole‑grain bread and add sliced banana or berries for fiber, which helps moderate the glycaemic impact.  \n3. **Swap occasionally** – Replace with a **nut‑free, lower‑sugar option** (e.g., plain almond butter with no added sugar) for most of the week.  \n4. **Mind the allergens** – The product contains **milk, hazelnuts and soy**; avoid if you’re allergic or intolerant.  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Aim for 1 – 2 small servings per week** (≈ 10‑20 g each time).  \n- Keep the spread thin, pair it with high‑fiber or high‑protein foods, and balance the rest of your daily diet to stay within recommended limits for added sugars (<10 % of total energy) and saturated fat (<10 % of total energy).  \n\nIf you need a **personalised plan** (e.g., based on your exact calorie target, activity level, or health condition), feel free to share those details and I can refine the weekly frequency and portion size for you."
